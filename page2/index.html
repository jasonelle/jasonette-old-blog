        Supercharged tab bar!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Feb 2017</span>

    <p>With the latest version, Jasonette now supports <a href="https://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-docs/href">href</a> and <a href="https://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-docs/action">action</a> attributes for the bottom tab bar, which lets you do cool things like open a view in a modal, or execute any actions when you tap a tab item.</p>

<p>Let me explain what this means.</p>

<h2>How it currently works</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-docs/document/#tabs">bottom tab bar</a> is useful for switching between multiple views.</p>

<p><img class='bordered medium' src='http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-docs/images/footer_tabs.jpeg'></p>

<p>Normally to make sure the each tab loads a separate view when tapped, you would simply specify the <code>url</code> attribute like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nt">"$jason"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nt">"body"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="nt">"footer"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="nt">"tabs"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
          </span><span class="nt">"items"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[{</span><span class="w">
            </span><span class="nt">"text"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Tab 1"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
            </span><span class="nt">"url"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"https://jasonbase.com/things/3fn.json"</span><span class="w">
          </span><span class="p">},</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
            </span><span class="nt">"text"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Tab 2"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
            </span><span class="nt">"url"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"https://jasonbase.com/things/2fn.json"</span><span class="w">
          </span><span class="p">},</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
            </span><span class="nt">"text"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Tab 3"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
            </span><span class="nt">"url"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"https://jasonbase.com/things/9fn.json"</span><span class="w">
          </span><span class="p">}]</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is sufficient for most use cases, but sometimes you want more. For example you may want to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open a new view as a modal instead of as a tab view.</li>
<li>Open a browser when you tap a tab item.</li>
<li>Exectue an action (Such as open a camera) when you tap.</li>
</ol>

<p>These things weren&#39;t possible since the only supported attribute was <code>url</code>.</p>

<p>However, this changes today. You can attach not only <code>url</code> but also <a href="https://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-docs/href/">href</a> as well as <a href="https://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-docs/actions/">action</a>.</p>

<p>Go download the <code>develop</code> branch (<a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-iOS">iOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android">Android</a>) and try it out. Here&#39;s what has changed:</p>

<h2>href</h2>

<p>You can now set <code>href</code> as well as <code>url</code>. <a href="https://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-docs/href/">href</a> is obviously more powerful since you can specify not just the url but also the <code>view</code> or the type of <code>transition</code>.</p>

<p><img class='bordered medium' src='http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/tab_href.gif'></p>

<p>See below example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nt">"$jason"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">

  </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div>
<ol>
<li><code>tab 1</code> uses the original <code>url</code> approach. It&#39;s simpler and usually works for most cases.</li>
<li><code>tab 2</code> now opens in a modal view when you tap, instead of opening within the current view.</li>
<li><code>tab 3</code> now opens a browser since it&#39;s a <code>&quot;view&quot;: &quot;web&quot;</code> type href.</li>
</ol>

<h2>action</h2>

<p>You can even set an <code>action</code> attribute for a tab. You may see something like this in photo apps like Instagram--you tap one of the tab bar items and it opens a camera.</p>

<p><img class='bordered medium' src='http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/tab_action.gif'></p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example:</p>

</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>Tab 2</code> now runs the <a href="https://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-docs/actions/#mediacamera">$media.camera action</a> when you tap.</p>

<p>Note that you can attach <strong>any</strong> kind of actions here, not just camera.</p>

<h2>Tip</h2>

<p>Sometimes people are confused about how the tabs work. Here&#39;s a rule of thumb:</p>

<p><strong>You MUST specify the tabs for every view.</strong></p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you have tab1, tab2, and tab3. All of those views MUST contain the <strong>same</strong> <code>tabs</code> object. If you only have the <code>tabs</code> object on <code>tab1</code>&#39;s markup, the tab bar will go away when you navigate away to tab2 or tab3.</p>

<h2>Try it out!</h2>

<p>As of today this works on both <a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android">Android</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-iOS">iOS</a></p>

        Remote-control your Slack bots with JSON
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2017</span>

    <p>A couple of days ago, <a href="https://github.com/shaunymca">@shaunymca</a> shared a really cool project on <a href="https://jasonette.now.sh/">our slack channel</a>.</p>

<p><img src='http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/coffeebot.png' class='bordered'></p>

<p>If you think about it, this is a pretty refreshing idea. Basically, it&#39;s <strong>a mobile app for remote-controlling a Slack bot.</strong> </p>

<p>To declare that you&#39;ve started brewing coffee, open the app, and simply touch the button from the cell with your name</p>

<p><img src='http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/coffeebot_original.png' class='medium bordered'></p>

<p>And in 12 minutes, </p>

<p><img src='http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/coffee_bot_slack.png' class='bordered'></p>

<p>And the cool part is, this was built with Jasonette, so <strong>he didn&#39;t need to write any native code.</strong></p>

<p>First, he wrote an express.js server which returns a JSON markup.</p>

<p>Then he connected it to <a href="https://www.jasonette.com">Jasonette</a>, which turned that JSON markup into a native app which drew the UI as well as sent requests to the server upon user input.</p>

<p>And voila! We have a remote control app for Slack bots.</p>

<p>Check out the repo here: <a href="https://github.com/shaunymca/coffeeapp">https://github.com/shaunymca/coffeeapp</a></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<p>I thought it was really cool so just decided to fork and try it out on our own slack channel. Here&#39;s how it works:</p>

<p>When the <a href="http://jasonelle.com/">Jasonette app</a> hits the home url, the server returns a JSON markup that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/coffee_json.png" alt="Coffee json"></p>

<p>Then, Jasonette turns it into a native app that looks like this:</p>

<p><span class='col-6'>
    <span>iOS</span>
    <img src='http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/coffee_app_ios.png' class='medium bordered'>
</span>
<span class='col-6'>
    <span>Android</span>
    <img src='http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/coffee_app_android.png' class='medium bordered'>
</span></p>

<p>So how does it work behind the scenes? Each cell item is represented by a JSON object in the markup, which has an <code>action</code> attribute that looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nt">"type"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"$network.request"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">

    </span><span class="nt">"method"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"POST"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">

<p>When you tap on a cell, it makes a <code>POST</code> request to the <a href="https://github.com/shaunymca/coffeeapp/blob/master/server.js#L61">submit.json</a> endpoint, which <a href="https://github.com/shaunymca/coffeeapp/blob/master/modules/slackPosting.js#L17">triggers the Slack API</a>.</p>

<p><strong>And in 12 minutes, your Slack channel will get a notification from the Coffee bot!.</strong></p>

<p><img src='http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/coffee_bot_slack.png' class='bordered'></p>

<h2>TLDR</h2>

<ol>
<li>The express server returns a <a href="https://github.com/shaunymca/coffeeapp/blob/master/modules/jsonette.js#L61">JSON markup</a>, which becomes a native app when you connect it with Jasonette.</li>
<li>When you tap an item from the app, it triggers a <a href="http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-docs/actions/#networkrequest">POST request</a> to the server.</li>
<li>The server waits 12 minutes, and then triggers the Slack API with credentials to post to the Slack channel.</li>
</ol>

<p><br></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This reminded me of the <a href="https://www.justyo.co/">Yo app</a>, since it&#39;s meant to only serve a single purpose.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like a bot version of Yo. But for multiplayer. And powered by Slack!</p>

<p>It&#39;s awesome to see these creative projects being built with Jasonette. Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonclient">reach out</a> if you built something cool using Jasonette. I will try to showcase them on the blog.</p>

<p><strong>Lastly, make sure to try out <a href="https://github.com/shaunymca">@shaunymca</a>&#39;s coffeebot app for your own slack channel! It&#39;s so cool! <a href="https://github.com/shaunymca/coffeeapp">https://github.com/shaunymca/coffeeapp</a>.</strong></p>

        Jasonette, 2016 in Review
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Jan 2017</span>

    <p>How are apps built?</p>

<p>You write a program and put it on the phone!</p>

<p>But what if you could represent an entire native app as JSON and <strong>load it on demand from the cloud over HTTP</strong>, just like a web page?</p>

<p><img src="http://jasonette.com/images/j.png" alt="image"></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>This little idea consumed the entirety of my life in 2016.</p>

<p>And the result is <a href="https://www.jasonette.com">Jasonette</a>.</p>

<p>Jasonette lets you <strong>build 100% native apps on Android and iOS simply by writing a single JSON markup.</strong> Watch the video below if you haven&#39;t yet. Your life will never be the same.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'>    <iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/hfevBAAfCMQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>When I look back at 2016, it really feels like ages because so many things happened.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s crazy to think that it&#39;s only been 2 months since I open sourced Jasonette!</p>

<p>Let me share my 2016 with you today.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2>Season 1 Pilot: Jason</h2>

<p>Exactly 8 months ago from today, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/jason">I released an app called Jason</a>. This was a standalone app that was a precursor to Jasonette. You would enter a JSON URL into Jason app&#39;s address bar, and it would instantly turn into your own custom app.</p>

<p><img class='center medium' src='http://web.archive.org/web/20170328121127im_/https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/www.jasonclient.org/intro.gif'></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>A lot of minds were blown:</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CirgXxKXAAEoOXt.jpg:large" alt="twitter"></p>

<p>But at the same time, this was one of the most esoteric apps one could build—an app within an app, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll">a russian doll</a> of sorts—as pointed out below:</p>

<p><img src="http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/ph.png" alt="ph"></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t even have a specific set of target users in mind when I built this. I just built it because I could.™</p>

<p>But I looked at all these reactions and thought about it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Other people were amazed that an app can be built this way, and wanted to build their own apps this way too.</li>
<li>I wasn&#39;t interested in just another way of building apps. I was more interested in lowering the barrier so significantly that it changes the meaning of the term &quot;app&quot;.</li>
<li>Charging for usage would beat the purpose since that would fail at lowering the barrier.</li>
</ol>

<p>I knew exactly what I had to do: Jason needed to be open sourced and completely set free.</p>

<p>Well it shouldn&#39;t be that hard to open source. After all, I already have a functional code base, right?</p>

<p>Hahaha. </p>

<p>It took me 6 months.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2>Intermission: Lessons learned from documentation</h2>

<p>Once I dived in, I soon realized open sourcing is not just about putting the code out there, but making sure people can understand it easily.</p>

<p>This was especially the case for Jasonette, because without a documented API, no one would be able to know what they can do with it. It would be like releasing a web browser without an HTML spec. Basically, the documentation itself was the product.</p>

<p>And turns out, documentation is not easy. </p>

<div class='jekyll-twitter-plugin'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Open source project is 1 percent inspiration, 99 percent documentation.</p>&mdash; ethan (@gliechtenstein) <a href="https://twitter.com/gliechtenstein/status/786284865733877764">October 12, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

<p><br></p>

<p>For the next 6 months, I did nothing but documentation and code cleanup.</p>

<p>These were my darkest days. I did nothing but work on the documentation, I wasn&#39;t creating something new, I was simply documenting something that already existed and I hated it. But what other options did I have? So I kept at it.</p>

<p><strong>However, I soon realized that</strong> while frustrating, the process of documenting the project was extremely helpful:</p>

<ol>
<li>I got to understand my own code better.</li>
<li>I found a lot of inconsistencies in the API while documenting, which needed to be refactored.</li>
<li>I gained a birds-eye point of view of the project, which was crucial when I started working on the Android version later.</li>
</ol>

<p>But the thing is, the more I documented, the more I had to refactor, and the more I refactored, the more I had to document to reflect the update. By working more, I was creating even more work. At some point I started feeling like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno&#x27;s_paradoxes#Achilles_and_the_tortoise">tortoise chasing after achilles</a>. Would I ever finish this?</p>

<p>In the meantime, I had set up a landing page and kept adding new materials as soon as they were ready, even though I hadn&#39;t launched it yet. And somehow people were discovering it and sharing it.</p>

<p>One day when I was begrudgingly working on documenting an <a href="https://github.com/Jasonette/s3-upload-example">express.js demo app</a> for Jasonette, I saw this tweet.</p>

<div class='jekyll-twitter-plugin'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">kind of interesting, 100% declarative apps with JSON <a href="https://t.co/hzjyhZKsmU">https://t.co/hzjyhZKsmU</a>, probably hella leaky abstraction in some cases but neat</p>&mdash; TJ Holowaychuk (@tjholowaychuk) <a href="https://twitter.com/tjholowaychuk/status/779092360487546880">September 22, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

<p>What a nice timing! I was very excited, and this encouraging tweet gave me all the strength I needed to finish up the docs and prepare for the launch... which wouldn&#39;t happen for another month and a half.</p>

<h2>Season 1 Episode 01. Jasonette-iOS</h2>

<p>On the morning of 11/4 <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12879179">I posted on Hacker News</a>. It shot up to #1 and stayed #1 the entire day.</p>

<p>Then it went on to become the <strong>#1 Github trending project</strong>. Not too bad for my first ever open source contribution!</p>

<p><img src="http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/github_trending.png" alt="github"></p>

<hr>

<h2>Season 1 Episode 02. Jasonette-Android</h2>

<p>Upon releasing the iOS version, the most frequently asked question was &quot;Android?&quot;. I wasn&#39;t surprised, since I knew that was the most obvious next step.</p>

<p>However what I didn&#39;t know was how long it would take me to come up with one.</p>

<p><strong>Or if it would be even possible at all.</strong></p>

<p>I only knew that Android had a layout system called <code>LinearLayout</code> which works similar to <code>UIStackView</code> which I used for the iOS version. So I just assumed that it would be possible, but it was really not straightforward.</p>

<p>This time, I decided not to torture myself with 6 months of agony. Instead of trying to make a perfect release, I decided to pick only the most crucial features and commit to releasing version 0 as soon as possible, and go from there.</p>

<p>I set the goal: <strong>Implement the core engine and get it out there, in 1 month.</strong></p>

<p>And surprisingly, I managed to succeed.</p>

<p>Watch the android version and the ios version side by side. These are loading from exactly the same JSON you can find <a href="https://github.com/Jasonette/Instagram-UI-example/blob/master/home.json">here</a></p>

<h2>Season 1 Finale: Current state of Jasonette community</h2>

<p>What excites me the most is that the project has managed to find a great community of people who share the same vision and all contributing to the project in many different ways.</p>

<h3>Open source is magic</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve never worked on open source before so all these contributions from people I&#39;ve never met still feel surreal to me.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really amazing how people from all around the world can come together and collaborate to build something together this easily.</p>

<h3>New features and projects</h3>

<p>I went back and took a look at what our community has accomplished during the two months Jasonette has been out, and looks like we did a lot.</p>

<p>Here are some of the <strong>new major features and projects</strong> we&#39;ve added since the launch (Not including bugfixes or iOS-to-Android feature port because that would make the list huuuge):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android"> 🔥 Jasonette-Android</a> - The name says it all. The Android implementation of Jasonette, which makes Jasonette fully cross platform.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/issues/13">Android binary size reduction</a> - Initially the Android binary size was huge, at over 40MB. We&#39;ve made some optimizations which dropped it down to around 9MB, all the while supporting 100% of the parsers (json, csv, rss, xml, html), thanks for the contribution <a href="https://github.com/brad">@brad</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/issues/7">Push notifications</a> - Push notifications on iOS purely powered by JSON. We will soon release this officially once we document the API and implement the Android version.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/pull/42">Local JSON</a> - This was one of the <a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/issues/48">most higly requested</a> features. Some people wanted to embed a JSON file in their project locally instead of fetching from a remote server. I initially was hesitant but soon became convinced that it can be useful in many cases. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/copongcopong">@copongcopong</a> for the implementation!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/issues/34">CocoaPods based extension management</a> - We had a long discussion thread about this on Github, and in the end, <a href="https://github.com/seletz">@seletz</a> implemented a solution which worked beautifully. We are currently working on the second iteration of extension management based on the insights we gained from this.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/pull/92">Ad integration</a> - This was also one of the <a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/issues/79">most highly requested</a> features as well. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/wajahatch888">@wajahatch888</a>, now we have AdMob support on iOS. <a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/issues/22">Android support</a> to come soon :)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/commit/b359ab6d44f88d54ca9a5240f0e62e4ec0ca6852">Deep linking</a> - Ability to open Jasonette apps using URL scheme (Example: <code>jasonette://href?url=https://www.jasonbase.com/things/dh3.json</code>)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/pull/20">Log action</a> - An action that lets you log anything during execution. Built by <a href="https://github.com/seletz">@seletz</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/pull/27">$background event</a> - An event to detect when the app goes into background mode. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/fretn">@fretz</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/pull/30">components border</a> - Add &quot;border&quot; attribute to component styles. Now, any component can have a border surrounding them, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/WenchaoD">@WenchaoD</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/pull/87">Loading indicator</a> - Another great feature addition by <a href="https://github.com/wajahatch888">@wajahatch888</a>. Displays a loading indicator when the content is loading.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/issues/30">HTML component for Android</a> - I had actually left out this feature on Android initially because I wasn&#39;t sure how performant it would be to have WebViews as components. <a href="https://github.com/brad">@brad</a> went on and just built it himself, and turns out that it works super smooth! Now works cross-platform both on iOS and Android.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/pull/94">Image button</a> - Initially the buttons could only display text. Now it&#39;s possible to use image buttons. Both on iOS and Android.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Important Contributions</h3>

<p>New features are exciting, but I think what&#39;s really important are things that we do to make the project itself much more maintainable and comprehensible so it&#39;s easier to work with. This includes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Adding automation to reduce repetitive tasks</li>
<li>Making it easier to work with Jasonette itself</li>
</ol>

<p>It&#39;s still very early days for Jasonette so we lack a lot of these things. And the community is coming up with various solutions. <strong>I especially welcome these contributions with open arms</strong>. Here are some of the highlights we&#39;ve achieved:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Jasonette/documentation/commit/eb5734484d07b49ec81a70c5eb8c017eaa342412">Auto-generate documentation using Travis CI</a> - As an open source newbie I had no idea you could just automatically generate a documentation, so have been manually doing it. Now it&#39;s all automated via <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gtramontina">@gtramontina</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/commit/0962d3bd2a7ccec7c091cb42a643055be7a03c6a">Integration with Code Climate</a> - I am learning about all kinds of great tools for maintaining and visualizing open source projects from contributions. <a href="https://codeclimate.com">Code Climate</a> is really nifty and lets you see problems with the code at a glance. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/lukeramsden">@lukeramsden</a> for the integration!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/commit/81cf25c9b26fad1e066027e28daa9f13cdaabe3a">Make it easy to use multiple targets in XCode</a> - I honestly had never thought about this idea. <a href="https://github.com/golopupinsky">@golopupinsky</a> found that it becomes tedious to use one Jasonette project to build multiple apps, and just came up with a solution, and I think it will be super useful for people who want to juggle between building multiple apps using a single Jasonette project file.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What next in 2017? - Season 2 Preview</h2>

<p>2016 was just the beginning. Our community is working on a lot of exciting things, and we plan to release tons of mind-blowing things in 2017. Here are some examples:</p>

<h3>Oauth</h3>

<p>This will be amazing once we roll out officially. It will be one of the most powerful features of Jasonette. Stay tuned :)</p>

<h3>Package Manager</h3>

<p>Jasonette was <a href="http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-docs/advanced/#extension">designed to be extensible</a>. However, while writing an extension for personal usage has been easy, it has always been difficult to share and distribute because of all the dependency management we had to deal with.</p>

<p>After having tried multiple approaches to managing extensions, we&#39;ve finally found the best way to make writing extensions dead simple. We are still working on it and plan to release it soon.</p>

<p>Expect to see a lot of cool additional features powered by JSON in 2017. </p>

<h3>Lambda</h3>

<p>I&#39;ll leave this up to your imagination :)</p>

<p>All I have to say is that this will take jasonette to the next level.</p>

<h3>Much more</h3>

<p>Of course, there are a lot of other cool projects which are still work in progress but I won&#39;t mention them here just to keep the mystery 😁 </p>

<p>Follow our project to stay updated!</p>

        Remote-control your Slack bots with JSON
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2016</span>

    <p><strong>Update:</strong> As a mistake I timestamped this as 2016, but this post was just freshly published on January 17th of 2017. Sorry for the confusion! :D </p>

<p>A couple of days ago, <a href="https://github.com/shaunymca">@shaunymca</a> shared a really cool project on <a href="https://jasonette.now.sh/">our slack channel</a>.</p>

<p><img src='http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/coffeebot.png' class='bordered'></p>

<p>If you think about it, this is a pretty refreshing idea. Basically, it&#39;s <strong>a mobile app for remote-controlling a Slack bot.</strong> </p>

<p>To declare that you&#39;ve started brewing coffee, open the app, and simply touch the button from the cell with your name</p>

<p><img src='http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/coffeebot_original.png' class='medium bordered'></p>

<p>And in 12 minutes, </p>

<p><img src='http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/coffee_bot_slack.png' class='bordered'></p>

<p>And the cool part is, this was built with Jasonette, so <strong>he didn&#39;t need to write any native code.</strong></p>

<p>First, he wrote an express.js server which returns a JSON markup.</p>

<p>Then he connected it to <a href="https://www.jasonette.com">Jasonette</a>, which turned that JSON markup into a native app which drew the UI as well as sent requests to the server upon user input.</p>

<p>And voila! We have a remote control app for Slack bots.</p>

<p>Check out the repo here: <a href="https://github.com/shaunymca/coffeeapp">https://github.com/shaunymca/coffeeapp</a></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<p>I thought it was really cool so just decided to fork and try it out on our own slack channel. Here&#39;s how it works:</p>

<p>When the <a href="http://jasonelle.com/">Jasonette app</a> hits the home url, the server returns a JSON markup that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/coffee_json.png" alt="Coffee json"></p>

<p>Then, Jasonette turns it into a native app that looks like this:</p>

<p><span class='col-6'>
    <span>iOS</span>
    <img src='http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/coffee_app_ios.png' class='medium bordered'>
</span>
<span class='col-6'>
    <span>Android</span>
    <img src='http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/coffee_app_android.png' class='medium bordered'>
</span></p>

<p>So how does it work behind the scenes? Each cell item is represented by a JSON object in the markup, which has an <code>action</code> attribute that looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nt">"type"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"$network.request"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nt">"options"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nt">"url"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"https://evening-inlet-32428.herokuapp.com/submit.json"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nt">"method"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"POST"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nt">"data"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="nt">"user_name"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"{{name}}"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="nt">"user_id"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"{{id}}"</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When you tap on a cell, it makes a <code>POST</code> request to the <a href="https://github.com/shaunymca/coffeeapp/blob/master/server.js#L61">submit.json</a> endpoint, which <a href="https://github.com/shaunymca/coffeeapp/blob/master/modules/slackPosting.js#L17">triggers the Slack API</a>.</p>

<p><strong>And in 12 minutes, your Slack channel will get a notification from the Coffee bot!.</strong></p>

<p><img src='http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/coffee_bot_slack.png' class='bordered'></p>

<h2>TLDR</h2>

<ol>
<li>The express server returns a <a href="https://github.com/shaunymca/coffeeapp/blob/master/modules/jsonette.js#L61">JSON markup</a>, which becomes a native app when you connect it with Jasonette.</li>
<li>When you tap an item from the app, it triggers a <a href="http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-docs/actions/#networkrequest">POST request</a> to the server.</li>
<li>The server waits 12 minutes, and then triggers the Slack API with credentials to post to the Slack channel.</li>
</ol>

<p><br></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This reminded me of the <a href="https://www.justyo.co/">Yo app</a>, since it&#39;s meant to only serve a single purpose.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like a bot version of Yo. But for multiplayer. And powered by Slack!</p>

<p>It&#39;s awesome to see these creative projects being built with Jasonette. Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonclient">reach out</a> if you built something cool using Jasonette. I will try to showcase them on the blog.</p>

<p><strong>Lastly, make sure to try out <a href="https://github.com/shaunymca">@shaunymca</a>&#39;s coffeebot app for your own slack channel! It&#39;s so cool! <a href="https://github.com/shaunymca/coffeeapp">https://github.com/shaunymca/coffeeapp</a>.</strong></p>

        Jasonette, 2016 in Review
      </a>

    <p>How are apps built?</p>

<p>You write a program and put it on the phone!</p>

<p>But what if you could represent an entire native app as JSON and <strong>load it on demand from the cloud over HTTP</strong>, just like a web page?</p>

<p><img src="http://jasonette.com/images/j.png" alt="image"></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>This little idea consumed the entirety of my life in 2016.</p>

<p>And the result is <a href="https://www.jasonette.com">Jasonette</a>.</p>

<p>Jasonette lets you <strong>build 100% native apps on Android and iOS simply by writing a single JSON markup.</strong> Watch the video below if you haven&#39;t yet. Your life will never be the same.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'>    <iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/hfevBAAfCMQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>When I look back at 2016, it really feels like ages because so many things happened.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s crazy to think that it&#39;s only been 2 months since I open sourced Jasonette!</p>

<p>Let me share my 2016 with you today.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2>Season 1 Pilot: Jason</h2>

<p>Exactly 8 months ago from today, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/jason">I released an app called Jason</a>. This was a standalone app that was a precursor to Jasonette. You would enter a JSON URL into Jason app&#39;s address bar, and it would instantly turn into your own custom app.</p>

<p><img class='center medium' src='http://web.archive.org/web/20170328121127im_/https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/www.jasonclient.org/intro.gif'></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>A lot of minds were blown:</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CirgXxKXAAEoOXt.jpg:large" alt="twitter"></p>

<p>But at the same time, this was one of the most esoteric apps one could build—an app within an app, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll">a russian doll</a> of sorts—as pointed out below:</p>

<p><img src="http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/ph.png" alt="ph"></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t even have a specific set of target users in mind when I built this. I just built it because I could.™</p>

<p>But I looked at all these reactions and thought about it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Other people were amazed that an app can be built this way, and wanted to build their own apps this way too.</li>
<li>I wasn&#39;t interested in just another way of building apps. I was more interested in lowering the barrier so significantly that it changes the meaning of the term &quot;app&quot;.</li>
<li>Charging for usage would beat the purpose since that would fail at lowering the barrier.</li>
</ol>

<p>I knew exactly what I had to do: Jason needed to be open sourced and completely set free.</p>

<p>Well it shouldn&#39;t be that hard to open source. After all, I already have a functional code base, right?</p>

<p>Hahaha. </p>

<p>It took me 6 months.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2>Intermission: Lessons learned from documentation</h2>

<p>Once I dived in, I soon realized open sourcing is not just about putting the code out there, but making sure people can understand it easily.</p>

<p>This was especially the case for Jasonette, because without a documented API, no one would be able to know what they can do with it. It would be like releasing a web browser without an HTML spec. Basically, the documentation itself was the product.</p>

<p>And turns out, documentation is not easy. </p>

<div class='jekyll-twitter-plugin'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Open source project is 1 percent inspiration, 99 percent documentation.</p>&mdash; ethan (@gliechtenstein) <a href="https://twitter.com/gliechtenstein/status/786284865733877764">October 12, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

<p><br></p>

<p>For the next 6 months, I did nothing but documentation and code cleanup.</p>

<p>These were my darkest days. I did nothing but work on the documentation, I wasn&#39;t creating something new, I was simply documenting something that already existed and I hated it. But what other options did I have? So I kept at it.</p>

<p><strong>However, I soon realized that</strong> while frustrating, the process of documenting the project was extremely helpful:</p>

<ol>
<li>I got to understand my own code better.</li>
<li>I found a lot of inconsistencies in the API while documenting, which needed to be refactored.</li>
<li>I gained a birds-eye point of view of the project, which was crucial when I started working on the Android version later.</li>
</ol>

<p>But the thing is, the more I documented, the more I had to refactor, and the more I refactored, the more I had to document to reflect the update. By working more, I was creating even more work. At some point I started feeling like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno&#x27;s_paradoxes#Achilles_and_the_tortoise">tortoise chasing after achilles</a>. Would I ever finish this?</p>

<p>In the meantime, I had set up a landing page and kept adding new materials as soon as they were ready, even though I hadn&#39;t launched it yet. And somehow people were discovering it and sharing it.</p>

<p>One day when I was begrudgingly working on documenting an <a href="https://github.com/Jasonette/s3-upload-example">express.js demo app</a> for Jasonette, I saw this tweet.</p>

<div class='jekyll-twitter-plugin'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">kind of interesting, 100% declarative apps with JSON <a href="https://t.co/hzjyhZKsmU">https://t.co/hzjyhZKsmU</a>, probably hella leaky abstraction in some cases but neat</p>&mdash; TJ Holowaychuk (@tjholowaychuk) <a href="https://twitter.com/tjholowaychuk/status/779092360487546880">September 22, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

<p>What a nice timing! I was very excited, and this encouraging tweet gave me all the strength I needed to finish up the docs and prepare for the launch... which wouldn&#39;t happen for another month and a half.</p>

<h2>Season 1 Episode 01. Jasonette-iOS</h2>

<p>On the morning of 11/4 <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12879179">I posted on Hacker News</a>. It shot up to #1 and stayed #1 the entire day.</p>

<p>Then it went on to become the <strong>#1 Github trending project</strong>. Not too bad for my first ever open source contribution!</p>

<p><img src="http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-blog/assets/github_trending.png" alt="github"></p>

<hr>

<h2>Season 1 Episode 02. Jasonette-Android</h2>

<p>Upon releasing the iOS version, the most frequently asked question was &quot;Android?&quot;. I wasn&#39;t surprised, since I knew that was the most obvious next step.</p>

<p>However what I didn&#39;t know was how long it would take me to come up with one.</p>

<p><strong>Or if it would be even possible at all.</strong></p>

<p>I only knew that Android had a layout system called <code>LinearLayout</code> which works similar to <code>UIStackView</code> which I used for the iOS version. So I just assumed that it would be possible, but it was really not straightforward.</p>

<p>This time, I decided not to torture myself with 6 months of agony. Instead of trying to make a perfect release, I decided to pick only the most crucial features and commit to releasing version 0 as soon as possible, and go from there.</p>

<p>I set the goal: <strong>Implement the core engine and get it out there, in 1 month.</strong></p>

<p>And surprisingly, I managed to succeed.</p>

<p>Watch the android version and the ios version side by side. These are loading from exactly the same JSON you can find <a href="https://github.com/Jasonette/Instagram-UI-example/blob/master/home.json">here</a></p>

<h2>Season 1 Finale: Current state of Jasonette community</h2>

<p>What excites me the most is that the project has managed to find a great community of people who share the same vision and all contributing to the project in many different ways.</p>

<h3>Open source is magic</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve never worked on open source before so all these contributions from people I&#39;ve never met still feel surreal to me.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really amazing how people from all around the world can come together and collaborate to build something together this easily.</p>

<h3>New features and projects</h3>

<p>I went back and took a look at what our community has accomplished during the two months Jasonette has been out, and looks like we did a lot.</p>

<p>Here are some of the <strong>new major features and projects</strong> we&#39;ve added since the launch (Not including bugfixes or iOS-to-Android feature port because that would make the list huuuge):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android"> 🔥 Jasonette-Android</a> - The name says it all. The Android implementation of Jasonette, which makes Jasonette fully cross platform.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/issues/13">Android binary size reduction</a> - Initially the Android binary size was huge, at over 40MB. We&#39;ve made some optimizations which dropped it down to around 9MB, all the while supporting 100% of the parsers (json, csv, rss, xml, html), thanks for the contribution <a href="https://github.com/brad">@brad</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/issues/7">Push notifications</a> - Push notifications on iOS purely powered by JSON. We will soon release this officially once we document the API and implement the Android version.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/pull/42">Local JSON</a> - This was one of the <a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/issues/48">most higly requested</a> features. Some people wanted to embed a JSON file in their project locally instead of fetching from a remote server. I initially was hesitant but soon became convinced that it can be useful in many cases. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/copongcopong">@copongcopong</a> for the implementation!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/issues/34">CocoaPods based extension management</a> - We had a long discussion thread about this on Github, and in the end, <a href="https://github.com/seletz">@seletz</a> implemented a solution which worked beautifully. We are currently working on the second iteration of extension management based on the insights we gained from this.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/pull/92">Ad integration</a> - This was also one of the <a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/issues/79">most highly requested</a> features as well. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/wajahatch888">@wajahatch888</a>, now we have AdMob support on iOS. <a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/issues/22">Android support</a> to come soon :)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/commit/b359ab6d44f88d54ca9a5240f0e62e4ec0ca6852">Deep linking</a> - Ability to open Jasonette apps using URL scheme (Example: <code>jasonette://href?url=https://www.jasonbase.com/things/dh3.json</code>)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/pull/20">Log action</a> - An action that lets you log anything during execution. Built by <a href="https://github.com/seletz">@seletz</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/pull/27">$background event</a> - An event to detect when the app goes into background mode. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/fretn">@fretz</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/pull/30">components border</a> - Add &quot;border&quot; attribute to component styles. Now, any component can have a border surrounding them, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/WenchaoD">@WenchaoD</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/pull/87">Loading indicator</a> - Another great feature addition by <a href="https://github.com/wajahatch888">@wajahatch888</a>. Displays a loading indicator when the content is loading.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/issues/30">HTML component for Android</a> - I had actually left out this feature on Android initially because I wasn&#39;t sure how performant it would be to have WebViews as components. <a href="https://github.com/brad">@brad</a> went on and just built it himself, and turns out that it works super smooth! Now works cross-platform both on iOS and Android.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/pull/94">Image button</a> - Initially the buttons could only display text. Now it&#39;s possible to use image buttons. Both on iOS and Android.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Important Contributions</h3>

<p>New features are exciting, but I think what&#39;s really important are things that we do to make the project itself much more maintainable and comprehensible so it&#39;s easier to work with. This includes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Adding automation to reduce repetitive tasks</li>
<li>Making it easier to work with Jasonette itself</li>
</ol>

<p>It&#39;s still very early days for Jasonette so we lack a lot of these things. And the community is coming up with various solutions. <strong>I especially welcome these contributions with open arms</strong>. Here are some of the highlights we&#39;ve achieved:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Jasonette/documentation/commit/eb5734484d07b49ec81a70c5eb8c017eaa342412">Auto-generate documentation using Travis CI</a> - As an open source newbie I had no idea you could just automatically generate a documentation, so have been manually doing it. Now it&#39;s all automated via <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gtramontina">@gtramontina</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/commit/0962d3bd2a7ccec7c091cb42a643055be7a03c6a">Integration with Code Climate</a> - I am learning about all kinds of great tools for maintaining and visualizing open source projects from contributions. <a href="https://codeclimate.com">Code Climate</a> is really nifty and lets you see problems with the code at a glance. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/lukeramsden">@lukeramsden</a> for the integration!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonelle/JASONETTE-Android/commit/81cf25c9b26fad1e066027e28daa9f13cdaabe3a">Make it easy to use multiple targets in XCode</a> - I honestly had never thought about this idea. <a href="https://github.com/golopupinsky">@golopupinsky</a> found that it becomes tedious to use one Jasonette project to build multiple apps, and just came up with a solution, and I think it will be super useful for people who want to juggle between building multiple apps using a single Jasonette project file.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What next in 2017? - Season 2 Preview</h2>

<p>2016 was just the beginning. Our community is working on a lot of exciting things, and we plan to release tons of mind-blowing things in 2017. Here are some examples:</p>

<h3>Oauth</h3>

<p>This will be amazing once we roll out officially. It will be one of the most powerful features of Jasonette. Stay tuned :)</p>

<h3>Package Manager</h3>

<p>Jasonette was <a href="http://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-docs/advanced/#extension">designed to be extensible</a>. However, while writing an extension for personal usage has been easy, it has always been difficult to share and distribute because of all the dependency management we had to deal with.</p>

<p>After having tried multiple approaches to managing extensions, we&#39;ve finally found the best way to make writing extensions dead simple. We are still working on it and plan to release it soon.</p>

<p>Expect to see a lot of cool additional features powered by JSON in 2017. </p>

<h3>Lambda</h3>

<p>I&#39;ll leave this up to your imagination :)</p>

<p>All I have to say is that this will take jasonette to the next level.</p>

<h3>Much more</h3>

<p>Of course, there are a lot of other cool projects which are still work in progress but I won&#39;t mention them here just to keep the mystery 😁 </p>

<p>Follow our project to stay updated!</p>
